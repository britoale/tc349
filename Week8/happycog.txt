Happycog.com seems to be a very user friendly and helpful website for any business looking to gain a web presence. I like that right away, the subtitle or h2 explains what the site does. The large header is nice and I might want to have a header like that for my final project. I have been noticing that lately, rather than a small window with tons of links and paths, websites have simply placed all their important information on a main page and allowed the user to scroll through it. Each different section is a different color to simplify things. I think this is better for web users that may not be very good at navigating pages with multiple links; scrolling is a lot easier to understand. 

I like all the examples and case studies of successful businesses that Happy Cog has helped. Everyone knows what Zappos is, so having them, and others like MTV share their successes with visitors is a great marketing strategy.The irony of this site, is that because it is a business that helps take a webiste to the next level in design, they themselves should have a great site to establish credibility, and they have most definitely done that.
