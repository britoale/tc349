<h1>Final Site: Plan and Card Sort</h1>

<h2>Website idea:</h2>
<p>For my final project I would like to put together a website for what college students in East Lansing call Bar Stars or people who frequent the bars in East Lansing, and bartenders too. It will be a less serious site, more humurous than anything. Since I work at a bar, we are always talking about creating a twitter or page to classify bars and inform college kids what are the right and the wrong ways to act a a bar.</p>



<div class="container">
<h2>Card Sorting:</h2>

<img src="cards.jpg" alt="cards" align="middle" height="300" width="300"/>



<p>Above is the image of my card sorting exercise. I will have a horizontal nav bar and also a list of links on the left side of the website. All of these links are on cards and the section are on cards with them. My nav bar will include:<p> 
  <ul>
	<li>About</li>
    <li>Bio</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
  </ul>
<p>The links or subcategories on the left side of the page will be:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Booze</li>
 <li>Bars</li>
 <li>Behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the three side links there are subcategories to take you to the different pages. For Booze there are subcategories like Drinking games, Shot and Drink Recipes, and Hangover Cures. For the Bars link, you are taken to a list of all the bars in the down town East Lansing area. You can click on each bar and see a picture, description of the bar, and their specials. Next, the Behavior link gives you two choices: The Good and The Bad behaviors that bartenders observe by bar stars every night.</p> 

<p>When I asked my mother to do the card sorting for my site she did it exactly how I set it up. I think that the straight forward categores of Booze, Bars, and Behavior made it easy for her to sort my other cards which had names of bars, shot recipes, lists of what to do or what not to do at the bar, specials for the bars, etc. After having others sort, I am confident that I have a good outline of what my site will look like structure wise.</p>
