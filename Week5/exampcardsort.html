<h2>After the exercise:</h2>
<p>After asking my mother, aunt, and boyfriend to do the card sorting I found that while a few of their choices were different, my boyfriends was the closest to the website and seemed to make the most sense. It is just a bit more condensed than the version by the website. My mother put the Free Delivery slide on the homepage and also put the interwebs card on the home page, which I didn't notice was actually on the homepage so there should have been two cards made for that.</p>
