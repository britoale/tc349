First off, the image on the right is very eye-catching and I like the numbers always changing. Every visual element of the site is almost three dimensional. The buttons, the texture on the lighter blue background part gives the page depth and the text shadowing adds to that too. The color scheme is nice and business like, yet calming because of all the blue. 

I like that right away you can tell what the site is about and how to go further, however it's a little bit overwhelming as you scroll down the page and see all the different aspects. I think that making seperate pages for some of these sections would have been a better idea becuase when a person has to scroll down and read too much to fully understand the concept of your site, they get bored and move on. I do like that at the bottom they acknoledge this fact though, it sort of exemplifies one of the tasks the site can perform if you choose to sign up.
