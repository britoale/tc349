I chose to write a review on the mobile site of one of my favorite stores- Victoria’s Secret.  Since I am always busy with work and school I find it easier to shop online and doing it from my phone makes it even easier than ever.  The irony of this being one of my favorite stores, is that they mobile site is NOT one of my favorite sites.  It’s complexity and layout are annoying and confusing.  When you enter the site you are immediately flipped sideways as the layout is horizontal rather than vertical like most mobile shopping sites I am used to.  Next there are moving, transparent images (a carosal of some sort) that are over a few links on the bottom of the page. Most of the links take you to different areas of the site and stay horizontal, but the “shop” link does not. Once you click on the “shop” link you are first flipped back to a vertical screen and then you are taken to what looks like a smaller version of the webpage on a normal computer. This page has tons of tiny links that are rather difficult to click on/navigate.  Basically, if I really wanted to buy something online at Victoria’s Secret, I wouldn’t do it on my phone.  The confusing and changing layout and multiple confusing links stressed me out instead of making my shopping experience easier.
