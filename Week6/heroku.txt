To be quite honest I don't fully understand what this site does. Obviously I need some more training on apps and deploying them. Is this another site like github? Is it another way to store content so you don't lose any if something goes wrong with your hard drive? I think there should be an even simpler explanation then the one provided. "How it works"...still don't get how it works. 

As far as the design elements go...I like the design layout but its kind of dark and intimidating. The background and header and footer portions are just too dark for me and make me feel like I really just don't want to be on the site because I don't know what it does and I don't know which thing to click on first. 

Forgot to say which layout I chose for my personal site and why...

I chose the double column layout because I think it looks the cleanest and the nicest. I am not quite sure if I am supposed to be making the layout changes to my final project or my personal site so I just did them to my personal site. I plan on using the same layout for my final site too, however.
