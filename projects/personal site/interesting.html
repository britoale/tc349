<h1>Interesting facts about me</h1>
	



	<h2>Some interesting things about me...</h2>
	
	<p>I am half Dominican. My father is from the Dominican Republic and lives there with the rest of the familiy. I have 4 younger half brothers by him, 14 aunts and uncles and over 40 cousins. I have only been there a few times, but I love it and feel so lucky to be able to experience a whole different life style when I am there.</p>

<p>I am obsessed with cats and have been long before it was a fad by todays hipsters.</p>

<p>I still live at home because I grew up in East Lansing and in fact went to high school, middle school, elementary school, and preschool here. All four are located on Burcham street!</p>

<p>I am really into astrology and don't care when people think I am weird for it.</p> 

<p>I hate snow and everything about it and hope to some day in the near future move to San Diego.</p>
