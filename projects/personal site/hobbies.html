<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	



	<h2>Let's see here, my hobbies include...</h2>
	
	<p>When I am not in school, I work a lot as a bartender at Harper's Brewpub in East Lansing. Bartending is definitely one of my passions and I have been doing it for almost 4 years.  I try to stay as active as possible, especially if it involves the outdoors! I am obsessed with watching scary movies (the horror genre is my favorite). Family is extremely important to me and I try and spend as much time with my Mom and Grandparents as I can.  This fall I have started getting into Fantasy Football and I must say, it is definitely getting me through a busy work and school season! I enjoy a good read, and not just books. I read a lot of blogs about the art of Zen and meditation. Like most people, I am a slave to the internet but I try and make my time spent on it productive.</p>
