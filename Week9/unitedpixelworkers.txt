At first, I really liked the look of this site as far as design goes. However, after spending a little more time scrolling through and reading, I decided that it's a bit too cluttered for my liking.  The whole grid layout and all of the colors paint a very confusing picture that is just too much for me. I like the idea of it, but somehow it doesn't look as good as a real, working site.  

They didn't really stick with a single color scheme, which I think could be one of the reasons the design isn't too pleasing to the eye.  I like the blues and oranges but throwing in the hot pink kind of looks awkward. I am a fan of the font though, I will say that. The font is fun and sort of "hip" (if you can describe a font like that haha).
