There isn't much to be said about the MSU mobile site, since there isn't much there! The MSU Mobile site is extremely simple. Almost too simple. I guess simple is good though, as that also means that it's user friendly and easy to keep up. I like that the site easily identifies what it is, and uses the green and white color scheme to do this as well.  The icons are a nice touch, as I am a visual person and can appreciate some nice icons! There aren't too little or too many icons either, just the basics. 

I notice that there is an option to go to the full MSU.edu website, which I think is really important.  I also think it was key to add a search box at the top since the simplicity of the design might make it more difficult to find something specific.
