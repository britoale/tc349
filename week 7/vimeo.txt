Vimeo is by far my favorite site we have critiqued thus far in the course. I love the image at the top and the huge header that says "Your video belongs here". That header alone helps the user understand what the site is for. The layout of this site is a lot more unique than others as the login option is smack dab in the middle rather than up in the right corner like in most user generated content sites. 

I like the huge carasol as you scroll down so you can get a preview of what is on this site.  I feel like that is better than youtubes approach which is showing a bunch of small videos clogging up the page. They also do a great job showing that they are different than youtube by the color scheme and overall design of the page; it's much more artistic and fun. I think this site is much more user friendly as well.
