<h1>Design critique for Panic.com:</h1>

<p>The explanation in the subheader is very clear cut and easy to understand. I love the use of images for buttons and the way they move when you hover your mouse over them. Not only do the images move, but an explanation pops up so you know what you are getting into if you decide to click on the image.  The white background emphasizes the colors of the images and title of the page. 

This page is very simple and organized in an easy to use, user-friendly manner. I like the simple links to the blog and t-shirts too. 

The bottom portion of the page is a very easy and creative alternative to what most sites would lable as a "contact us" link at the top of a boring cookie-cutter page.
