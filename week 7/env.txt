I chose to use Tincta as my text editor and to develop my websites because I took this class in the summer and I found that it was the easiest to navigate and figure out. It's very user-friendly and you can easily open your document in a browser. 

I also like that on the left side is a list of all the documents you have been working on and you can switch easily from document to document without any hassle. This comes in handy when you may be working on java, CSS, and HTML all at the same time. 

The "search" button is nice to because if you are looking for a specific attribute or word of your document but it is extremely long, you can search it and delete it or replace it or edit it very easily.
