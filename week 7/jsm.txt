jasonsantamaria.com looks like a fancy blog. The way he has the dates on the left side and the headers and pictures following is fairly easy to understand and grasp. Nothing really grabs my attention though unfortunately and there isnt an explanation as to what the site is about. Usually when you go to a website there is a short explanation under the title of the page.

As far as colors go, I can definitely appreciate a nice clean white background with black writing. Being a fire sign, I also enjoyed his accent color choice of red. The gray writing for the dates isn't my favorite but I think he was going for a subdued color that wouldn't take over the headers next to them. 

Although this page is organized and straight forward, it is a little dry and boring. The layout and graph-like appearance looks like a chore for me to read and pushes me away from delving further into the site.
