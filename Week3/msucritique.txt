When I look at the Michigan State University home page, it is obvious that it is a serious and well organized website.  The color scheme is pretty muted to set a serious tone.  I love the feature of the constantly changing image in the middle that keeps your eye focused on that.  I like that when you scroll over the links at the top that they drop down menus appear.  The color effect on the top green bar where the color gets darker near the top really adds some dimension to the page and makes it look more modern and professional, as well as the shadowy floating effect of the middle boxes on the white background of the whole page.  As far as the layout goes, I like the size of the header and the ratio and placement of the body portion of the page.  The logo is nice and big so you know what webpage you are currently on and the navigation is also big enough to see and easy to use.
